# A Golang coding Challenge 🌞😰👷🏾‍♂️

#### Experiences drawn from using golang... Goal of this is to experiment on new ideas starting from first principle.

### Disclaimer
`Codes written here are a reflection of my thought processes in solving some problems and in no way shows the thought process of any organization I've worked with currently or in the past`

# Objective 

* Building different systems that could be used in real-world applications
* Demonstrate the possibility of solving different problems using technical reasoning 
* Using first principle to try to approach design of complex systems


## Technical Considerations

` Well most of my codes will be written in Golang, but will also look at the possibliity of other frameworks and languages like Flask, Django, Python, C, C++ during the course of this journey`

### Project Structure  

⚠️ `WIP`

* --> `starter_pack` : Is basically intros and stuffs for the kids, Getting started with Go? Just check that out.
* --> `use_cases` : Is thinkering box where I consider real world problems that I could solve with program.


### Discoveries 

`This is where I document algorithms that have use_cases beyond my current application`

⚠️ `DIP`

* --> `Article Slicing` : An algorithm to breakdown an article or paragraph text into sections. The assumptions are below:
       * The article has a known structure and flow
       * The headers are not repeated on the body of the section (This hasn't been fully tested, so my confidence level to it's working is low)


### Final thoughts 

` I might have plans in the future to welcome contributions and possibly publish some of these APIs to public domain. But let's see how it goes `.


#### Cheers to the start of another 10 years. 🍾🎉🥳
